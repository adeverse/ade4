# ade4 book

The book [Multivariate Analysis of Ecological Data with
`ade4`](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-8850-1) is
available on Springer website.

This book is implemented around the mathematical concept of the duality
diagram and provides a unified framework for multivariate data analysis.
It offers a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework of the
**ade4** package and of its application to real-world ecological
problems. The organization of the book is based on ecological questions,
but these questions correspond to particular classes of data analysis
methods. The first chapters present both usual and multiway data
analysis methods. Further chapters are dedicated for example to the
analysis of spatial data, of phylogenetic structures, and of
biodiversity patterns. One chapter deals with multivariate data analysis
graphs.

In each chapter of the book, the basic mathematical definitions of the
methods and the outputs of the R functions available in **ade4** are
detailed in several boxes. The text of the book itself can be read
independently from these boxes. Thus this book offers the opportunity to
find information about the ecological situation from which a question
raises alongside the mathematical properties of methods that can be
applied to answer this question, as well as the details of software
outputs.

All the **R** code examples and the graphs in this book can be
