## 	Presentation

**ade4** is a software developed in the Biometry and Evolutionary Biology Lab (UMR 5558) - University Lyon 1 for the **D**ata **A**nalysis of **E**cological and **E**nvironmental data in the framework of **E**uclidean **E**xploratory methods, hence the name **ade4**.

**ade4** is a package for the [**R** software](https://www.r-project.org) since 2002. It contains functions for exploratory multivariate data analysis and graphical display, many numerical data sets and bibliographic references. Simple one-table methods are described in [Chessel et al. (2004)](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/ref/ade4-Rnews.pdf). Two-table and K-table methods are described in [Dray et al. (2007)](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4/article/rnews2/rnews2.pdf). The theory of the duality diagram and its implementation in ade4 are discussed in [Dray et Dufour (2007)](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ade4/article/jss/jss.pdf).

A book in the *Springer Series in Statistics* collection, [**"Multivariate Analysis of Ecological Data with ade4"**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-8850-1) presents the package. It is implemented around the mathematical concept of the duality diagram and provides a unified framework for multivariate data analysis. It offers a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework of the **ade4** package and of its application to real-world ecological problems. The organization of the book is based on ecological questions, but these questions correspond to particular classes of data analysis methods. The first chapters present both usual and multiway data analysis methods. Further chapters are dedicated for example to the analysis of spatial data, of phylogenetic structures, and of biodiversity patterns. One chapter deals with multivariate data analysis graphs.

In each chapter of the book, the basic mathematical definitions of the methods and the outputs of the R functions available in **ade4** are detailed in several boxes. The text of the book itself can be read independently from these boxes. Thus this book offers the opportunity to find information about the ecological situation from which a question raises alongside the mathematical properties of methods that can be applied to answer this question, as well as the details of software outputs. Each example and all the graphs in this book come with [**executable R code**](https://lbbe-shiny.univ-lyon1.fr/Reproducible_Research/Book/).

## Getting started with **ade4**

### Installing **ade4**

[This page](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/articles/install.html) explains how to install the **ade4** package in **R**.

### Vignettes

Vignettes are available to help you get started with **ade4** (more to come soon !):

- [Description of environmental variables structures](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/articles/ChapEnvVarStruct.html)

- [Description of species structures](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/articles/ChapSpeciesStruct.html)

### List of function references

You can also find a list of functions available to users on the [reference page](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/reference/index.html).

### Other resources

Check out the [ade4 book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-8850-1) and its [shiny application](https://ade4.shinyapps.io/Book/) for a complete introduction to the package and to rerun the code present in the book. 
You can also check these [bibliographic references](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/articles/papers.html) to help you understand **ade4** methods.

### Using **ade4** online: the Shiny app

Consider giving a try to our shiny app, developed to allow you to run an analysis without having to write your own script: [ade4shiny](https://lbbe-shiny.univ-lyon1.fr/Reproducible_Research/ShinyADE4/).
You will be able to download the R script used to generate the results as well as the analyses outputs and graphical representations.

### Getting help: FAQ & Mailing list

You can also check the [FAQ section](http://sdray.github.io/ade4/articles/faq.html) to check if your question has already been answered or ask for help on the **ade4** mailing list [adelist](https://listes.univ-lyon1.fr/sympa/info/adelist).
