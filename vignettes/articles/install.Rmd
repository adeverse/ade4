## Installing the *development* version of `ade4`

- Install the release version of `remotes` from CRAN with `install.packages("remotes")`.

- Make sure you have a working development environment.
    * **Windows**: Install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
    * **Mac**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
    * **Linux**: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across different flavors of Linux).
    
Then:

```r
remotes::install_github("adeverse/ade4")
```


If you do not wish to install the development environments Rtools (Windows) / XCode (Mac), we can supply binary packages of the development version of `ade4` on request. 

You can also find these binary packages as artifacts of GitHub Actions: [here](https://github.com/adeverse/ade4/actions/workflows/build-bin-windows.yaml) for Windows and [here](https://github.com/adeverse/ade4/actions/workflows/build-bin-macOS-x64.yaml) and [here](https://github.com/adeverse/ade4/actions/workflows/build-bin-macOS-M1.yaml) for macOS.


## Installing the *stable* version of `ade4`
